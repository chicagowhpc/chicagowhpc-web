The Chicago Women in HPC mission is to create an all inclusive community of women in high-performance computing in the midwest region and serve a role of a central hub for involvement, education, and support to current and future students as well as aspiring professionals. 

We strive to empower, inspire, mentor, and educate women of minorities across all strata of the high-performance computing field. The Chicago WHPC aims to help participants toward HPC professional career paths by providing HPC resources, support and by creating a collaborative environment to share and incubate ideas. 

We help our participants build a professional network by offering training, workshops and mentorship programs featuring inspirational keynote speakers in the world of HPC. We also foster collaboration and connections amongst existing diversity and inclusion initiatives through the development of different outreach programs and activities for HPC.
