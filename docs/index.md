### Despite numerous initiatives towards combating gender inequalities, women only occupy approximately 25% of research positions in science and engineering.

Even though, in life sciences, women’s enrolment in universities is relatively high, their participation goes down along the more senior steps of a researcher’s career path, with only a fraction reaching decision-making faculty positions.

Acutely aware of this global trend, the Chicago Women in HPC (WHPC) chapter has committed to providing a supportive learning environment for women. We know that diversity and equality lead to successful scientific research ([ref](https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter), [ref2](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2200841119)). In particular, gender balance enables the realization of the full potential of the best scientific talents. On the other hand, knowledge of HPC and its applications paves the way for new innovations in science, technology, business and academia.

As part of roadmap, our chapter is launching an innovative and holistic mentoring program for women in high-performance computing that involves meetings, coaching and workshops, where experienced mentors and external partners provide guidance, empowerment and inspiration. 

Help make equality possible! Join forces with our chapter to inspire and empower the next generation of women in high performance computing!
