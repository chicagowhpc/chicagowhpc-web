# About the Chicago Women in HPC Chapter

### Despite numerous initiatives towards combating gender inequalities, women only occupy approximately 25% of research positions in science and engineering.

Even though, in life sciences, women’s enrolment in universities is relatively high, their participation goes down along the more senior steps of a researcher’s career path, with only a fraction reaching decision-making faculty positions.

Acutely aware of this global trend, the Chicago Women in HPC (WHPC) chapter has committed to providing a supportive learning environment for women. We know that diversity and equality lead to successful scientific research ([ref](https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter), [ref2](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2200841119)). In particular, gender balance enables the realization of the full potential of the best scientific talents. On the other hand, knowledge of HPC and its applications paves the way for new innovations in science, technology, business and academia.

As part of roadmap, our chapter is launching an innovative and holistic mentoring program for women in high-performance computing that involves meetings, coaching and workshops, where experienced mentors and external partners provide guidance, empowerment and inspiration. 

Help make equality possible! Join forces with our chapter to inspire and empower the next generation of women in high performance computing!

## Mission 

The Chicago WHPC mission is to create an all inclusive community of women in High Performance computing in the region and serve a role of a central hub for involvement, education, and support to current and future students as well as aspiring professionals. 

## Goals 

We strive to empower, inspire, mentor, and educate women of minorities across all strata of the high-performance computing field. The Chicago WHPC aims to help participants toward HPC professional career paths by providing HPC resources, support and by creating a collaborative environment to share and incubate ideas. 

We help our participants build a professional network by offering training, workshops and mentorship programs featuring inspirational keynote speakers in the world of HPC. We also foster collaboration and connections amongst existing diversity and inclusion initiatives through the development of different outreach programs and activities for HPC.
